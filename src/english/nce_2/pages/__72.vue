<article> <h1>A car called bluebird</h1> <p>What 【mistake】 was made?</p> <p>The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell,                 was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour. He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville                 Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird, the car he was driving, had been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in length                 and had a 2,500-horsepower engine. Although Campbell reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour, he had great                 difficulty in controlling the car because a tyre burst during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell was                 disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour. However, a few days later, he was told                 that                 a mistake had been made. His average speed had been 301 miles per hour. Since that time, racing drivers have reached                 speeds over 600 miles an hour. Following in his fathers footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolms son, Donald, also                 set                 up a world record. Like his father, he was driving a car called Bluebird.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>mistake</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（言语或行为上的）错误，失误|an action or an opinion that is not correct, or that produces a result that you did not want                         </dt> <dd>It's easy to make a mistake.|犯错误很容易。</dd> <dd>This letter is addressed to someone else─there must be some mistake.|这封信是给别人的——一定是搞错了。</dd> <dd>It would be a mistake to ignore his opinion.|忽略他的意见是不对的。</dd> <dd>Don't worry, we all make mistakes.|没关系，我们都会犯错。</dd> <dd>You must try to learn from your mistakes.|你得从所犯错误中吸取教训。</dd> <dd>Leaving school so young was the biggest mistake of my life.|我一生中最大的错误就是那么年轻就离开了学校。</dd> <dd>I made the mistake of giving him my address.|我真不该把我的地址给他。</dd> <dd>It was a big mistake on my part to have trusted her.|我相信了她，这是我的一大错误。</dd> <dd>a great/serious/terrible mistake|大错；严重错误</dd> <dd>It's a common mistake (= one that a lot of people make).|这是常犯的错误。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
