<article> <h1>A thirsty ghost</h1> <p>What evidence is there of a 【ghost】?</p> <p>A public house which was recently bought                 by Mr.Ian Thompson is up for sale. Mr.Thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted. He told me that he could                 not                 go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise coming from the bar. The next morning, he found that the                 doors                 had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he                 went to bed, they were on in the morning. He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which the ghost                 must have drunk the night before. When I suggested that some villagers must have come in for a free drink,                 Mr.Thompson                 shook his head. The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>ghost</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 鬼；鬼魂；幽灵|the spirit of a dead person that a living person believes they can see or hear</dt> <dd>Do you believe in ghosts (= believe that they exist)?|你相信有鬼吗？</dd> <dd>the ghost of her father that had come back to haunt her|萦绕在她脑际的父亲的幽灵</dd> <dd>He looked as if he had seen a ghost (= looked very frightened).|他那副样子就像是见到鬼一样。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
