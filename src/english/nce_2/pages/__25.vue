<article> <h1>Do the English speak English？</h1> <p>Why does the writer not understand the 【porter】?</p> <p>I arrived in                 London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a                 porter.                 I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could not understand me. I                 repeated my question several times and at last he understood. he answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor                 clearly.                 I am a foreigner, I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like                 that! The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. Youll soon learn                 English! he said. I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other,                 but I dont understand them!
