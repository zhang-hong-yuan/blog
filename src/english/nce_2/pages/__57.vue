<article> <h1>Can I help you, madam？</h1> <p>Did the woman get what she wanted?</p> <p>A woman in 【jeans】 stood at the                 window of an expensive shop. Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that                 was                 in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed. Glancing at her scornfully, he                 told                 her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day.                 She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella                 in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the                 assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress.                 As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost                 everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>jeans</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[pl.]牛仔裤；粗斜纹棉布裤|trousers/pants made of strong cotton, especially denim</dt> <dd>a faded pair of blue jeans|一条退了色的蓝色牛仔裤</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
