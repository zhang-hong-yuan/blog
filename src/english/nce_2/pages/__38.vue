<article> <h1>Everything except the weather</h1><br> <p>Why did Harrison sell his house so quickly?</p> <p>My old friend,                 Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England. He had often dreamed of                 retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner returned than he bought a house                 and went to live there. Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still                 summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock.                 He acted as if he had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had hardly had                 time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The dream he had had for so many years ended there.                 Harrison had thought of everything 【except】 the weather.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>except</h4> <dl> <dt>prep.also except for（用于所言不包括的人或事物前）除…之外|used before you mention the only thing or person about which a                                 statement is not true</dt> <dd>同义词： apart from</dd> <dd>We work every day except Sunday.|我们除星期天外每天都工作。</dd> <dd>They all came except Matt.|除马特外他们都来了。</dd> <dd>I had nothing on except for my socks.|我除了短袜什么都没穿。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
