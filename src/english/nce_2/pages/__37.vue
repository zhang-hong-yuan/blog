As a great many people will be visiting the country, the                 【government】 will be building new hotels, an immense stadium, and a new Olympic-standard swimming pool. They will                 also                 be building new roads and a special railway line. The Games will be held just outside the capital and the whole area                 will be called Olympic City. Workers will have completed the new roads by the end of this year. By the end of next                 year, they will have finished work on the new stadium. The fantastic modern buildings have been designed by Kurt                 Gunter.
