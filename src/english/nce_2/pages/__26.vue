<article> <h1>The best art 【critics】</h1> <p>Who is the students best critic?</p> <p>I am an art student and I paint a lot                 of pictures. Many people pretend that they understand modern art. They always tell you what a picture is about. Of                 course, many pictures are not about anything. They are just pretty patterns. We like them in the same way that we                 like                 pretty curtain material. I think that young children often appreciate modern pictures better than anyone else. They                 notice more. My sister is only seven, but she always tells me whether my pictures are good or not. She came into my                 room yesterday.</p> <p>‘What are you doing?’ she asked.</p> <p>‘I'm hanging this picture on the wall,’ I answered. ‘It's a new one.                 Do you like it?’</p> <p>She looked at it critically for a moment. ‘It's all right,’ she said, ‘but isn't it upside down?’</p> <p>I looked at it again. She was right! It was!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>critic</h4> <dl> <dt>n.批评家；评论家；评论员|a person who expresses opinions about the good and bad qualities of books, music, etc.</dt> <dd>a music/theatre/literary, etc. critic|音乐、戏剧、文学等评论家</dd> <dd>The critics loved the movie.|评论家喜爱这部电影。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
