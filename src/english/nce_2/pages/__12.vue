		<h1>Goodbye and good luck</h1>
	<p>Where is 【Captain】 Alison going and how?</p>
	<p>Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison, will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow. Well meet him at the harbour early in
		the morning. He will be in his small boat, Topsail. Topsail is a famous little boat. It has sailed across the
		Atlantic many times. Captain Alison will set out at eight oclock, so well have plenty of time. Well see his boat and
		then well say goodbye to him. He will be away for two months. We are very proud of him. He will take part in an
		important race across the Atlantic.</p>
