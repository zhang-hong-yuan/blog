<article> <h1>A slip of the tongue</h1> <p>Who made the only funny joke that evening and why?</p> <p>People will do                 anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one. When the news got round that a 【comedy】 show would be                 presented                 at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all rushed to see it. We had to queue for hours to get in                 and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began. Unfortunately, the show was one                 of                 the dullest we have ever seen. Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes                 who                 should have appeared did not come. The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the                 beginning of the programme. He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the                 microphone.                 As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing. We all know what the poor man should have said, but                 what                 he actually said was: 'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!""</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>comedy</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C, U] 喜剧；喜剧片|a play or film/movie that is intended to be funny, usually with a happy ending; plays and                                 films/movies of this type</dt> <dd>compare tragedy(2)</dd> <dd>a romantic comedy|浪漫喜剧</dd> <dd>slapstick comedy|打闹剧</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
