<article> <h1>Trouble with the Hubble</h1> <p>What is the special importance of a 【telescope】 in space?</p> <p>The Hubble                 telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20,1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars. Right from the start                 there was trouble with the Hubble. The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was                 faulty!                 NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it. The                 shuttle                 Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble. A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and                 hold                 it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs. Of course, the Hubble is above the earths atmosphere, so it will                 soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen. The Hubble will                 tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe. By the time you read this, the Hubbles eagle eye will                 have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>telescope</h4> <dl> <dt>n.望远镜|a piece of equipment shaped like a tube, containing lenses , that you look through to make objects that                                 are far away appear larger and nearer</dt> <dd>to look at the stars through a telescope|用望远镜观察星星</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
