<article> <h1>Mad or not？</h1> <p>Why do people think the writer is 【mad】?</p> <p>Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I                 live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years ago, but for some                 reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven                 away from their homes by the noise. I am one of the few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked                 down                 by a passing plane. I have been offered a large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody                 says I must be mad and they are probably right.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>mad</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.(especially BrE) 疯的；神经错乱的；有精神病的|having a mind that does not work normally; mentally ill</dt> <dd>They realized that he had gone mad.|他们意识到他疯了。</dd> <dd>Inventors are not mad scientists.|发明家不是精神不正常的科学家。</dd> <dd>I'll go mad if I have to wait much longer.|如果还要等更久的话，我会发疯的。</dd> <dd>She seemed to have gone stark raving mad.|她好像是完全疯了。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
