<article> <h1>A 【famous】 clock</h1> <p>Has Big Ben ever gone wrong?</p> <p>When you visit London, one of the first things                 you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the B.B.C. If the Houses of                 Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name                 from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being                 built. It is not only of immense size, but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have                 the clock checked twice a day. On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones                 are connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time.                 A painter who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>famous</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.著名的；出名的|known about by many people</dt> <dd>a famous artist/hotel|著名的艺术家 / 旅馆</dd> <dd>the most famous lake in Italy|意大利最著名的湖</dd> <dd>He became internationally famous for his novels.|他以小说享誉国际。</dd> <dd>One day, I'll be rich and famous.|总有一天我会名利双收。</dd> <dd>She was more famous as a writer than as a singer.|她作为作家比作为歌手名声要大。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
