<article> <h1>Not a gold mine</h1> <p>What did the team find?</p> <p>Dreams of finding lost 【treasure】 almost came true                 recently. A new machine called The Revealer has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been                 buried in the ground. The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates used to hide                 gold. The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a                 search                 party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil near the                 entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a                 hole                 two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole                 cave                 thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk. In spite of this, many people are confident that The                 Revealer may reveal something of value fairly soon.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>treasure</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 金银财宝；珠宝；财富|a collection of valuable things such as gold, silver and jewellery</dt> <dd>buried treasure|埋藏的财宝</dd> <dd>a pirate's treasure chest|海盗的财宝箱</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
