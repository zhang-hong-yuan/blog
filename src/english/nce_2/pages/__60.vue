<article> <h1>The future</h1> <p>Does what Madam Bellinsky said come true?</p> <p>At a village 【fair】, I decided to visit                 a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky. I went into her tent and she told me to sit down. After I had given her                 some                 money, she looked into a crystal ball and said: A relation of yours is coming to see you. She will be arriving this                 evening and intends to stay for a few days. The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you                 know well will rush towards you. She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place. That is                 all.</p> <p>As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me. Where have                 you been hiding? she asked impatiently. Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station                 to                 meet her. We are late already. As she walked away, I followed her out of the fair.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>fair</h4> <dl> <dt>n.(NAmE) （评比农畜产品的）集市|a type of entertainment in a field or park at which farm animals and products are shown                                 and take part in competitions</dt> <dd>the county/state fair|县 / 州农畜产品集市</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
