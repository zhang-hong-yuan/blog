<article> <h1>Out of the darkness</h1> <p>Why was the girl in 【hospital】?</p> <p>Nearly a week passed before the girl was                 able to explain what had happened to her. One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small boat and was caught in                 a                 storm. Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl jumped into the sea. Then she swam to the shore after                 spending the whole night in the water. During that time she covered a distance of eight miles. Early next morning,                 she                 saw a light ahead. She knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs. On arriving at the                 shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light she had seen. That was all she remembered. When she woke up                 a                 day later, she found herself in hospital.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>hospital</h4> <dl> <dt>n.医院|a large building where people who are ill/sick or injured are given medical treatment and care</dt> <dd>(BrE) He had to go to hospital for treatment.|他不得不去医院接受治疗。</dd> <dd>(NAmE) He had to go to the hospital for treatment.|他不得不去医院接受治疗。</dd> <dd>to be admitted to (the) hospital|被接受入院</dd> <dd>to be discharged from (the) hospital|获准出院</dd> <dd>The injured were rushed to (the) hospital in an ambulance.|救护车把伤员火速送往医院。</dd> <dd>He died in (the) hospital.|他在医院里去世。</dd> <dd>I'm going to the hospital to visit my brother.|我要去医院探望我弟弟。</dd> <dd>a psychiatric/mental hospital|精神病院</dd> <dd>hospital doctors/nurses/staff|医院医生 / 护士 / 职工</dd> <dd>There is an urgent need for more hospital beds.|医院床位急需增加。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
