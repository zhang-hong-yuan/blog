<article> <h1>A clear 【conscience】</h1> <p>How did Sam get his money back?</p> <p>The whole village soon learnt that a                 large sum of money had been lost. Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the                 post office. Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to                 him. Three months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his wallet outside his front door. It had been wrapped up                 in                 newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost, together with a note which said: A thief, yes, but only 50                 per                 cent a thief! Two months later, some more money was sent to Sam with another note: Only 25 per cent a thief now! In                 time, all Sams money was paid back in this way. The last note said: I am 100 per cent honest now!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>conscience</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C, U] 良心；良知|the part of your mind that tells you whether your actions are right or wrong</dt> <dd>to have a clear/guilty conscience (= to feel that you have done right/wrong)|问心无愧 / 有愧</dd> <dd>This is a matter of individual conscience (= everyone must make their own judgement about it).|这关系个人的良知。</dd> <dd>He won't let it trouble his conscience.|他不会让这件事搞得自己良心不安。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
