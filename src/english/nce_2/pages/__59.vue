<article> <h1>In or out？</h1> <p>Why did Rex run away?</p> <p>Our dog, Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and 【bark】.                 Every time he wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate. As the neighbours                 complained                 of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became                 an                 expert at opening the gate. However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the                 gate. This time he was barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As                 soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then he sits                 and                 barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my                 husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>bark</h4> <dl> <dt>v.[V] ~ (at sb/sth)（狗）吠叫|when a dog barks , it makes a short loud sound</dt> <dd>The dog suddenly started barking at us.|那条狗突然开始对我们汪汪叫。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
