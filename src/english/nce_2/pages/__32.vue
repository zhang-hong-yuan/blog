		<h1>Shopping made easy</h1>
		<p>Who was the thief?</p>
		<p>People are not so honest as they once were. The 【temptation】 to steal is greater than ever before -- especially in
			large shops. A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday
			mornings. One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for
			the detective to watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she chose one of the
			most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.
			Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was arrested, the
			detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter. The girl gave her mother a free dress once a week!</p>
