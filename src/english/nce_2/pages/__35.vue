<article> <h1>Stop thief！</h1> <p>How did Roy stop the thieves?</p> <p>Roy Trenton used to drive a taxi. A short while                 ago, however, he became a bus driver and he has not 【regretted】 it. He is finding his new work far more exciting.                 When                 he was driving along Catford Street recently, he saw two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a waiting car.                 One                 of them was carrying a bag full of money. Roy acted quickly and drove the bus straight at the thieves. The one with                 the money got such a fright that he dropped the bag. As the thieves were trying to get away in their car, Roy drove                 his bus into the back of it. While the battered car was moving away, Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police.                 The thieves car was badly damaged and easy to recognize. Shortly afterwards, the police stopped the car and both men                 were arrested.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>regret</h4> <dl> <dt>v.感到遗憾；惋惜；懊悔|to feel sorry about sth you have done or about sth that you have not been able to do</dt> <dd>[VN] If you don't do it now, you'll only regret it.|你如果现在不做，以后一定会后悔的。</dd> <dd>The decision could be one he lives to regret.|这一决定也许会有让他后悔的一日。</dd> <dd>‘I've had a wonderful life,’ she said, ‘I don't regret a thing.’|“我一辈子生活得很好，”她说，“我没什么可遗憾的。”</dd> <dd>[V -ing] He bitterly regretted ever having mentioned it.|他非常懊悔提起那件事。</dd> <dd>[V wh-] I deeply regret what I said.|我非常后悔说了那些话。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
