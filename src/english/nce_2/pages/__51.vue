<article> <h1>Reward for virtue</h1> <p>Why did Hugh's 【diet】 not work?</p> <p>My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but                 things got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet. He began his diet a week ago. First of all, he wrote out                 a                 long list of all the foods which were forbidden. The list included most of the things Hugh loves: butter, potatoes,                 rice, beer, milk, 【chocolate】; and sweets. Yesterday I paid him a visit. I rang the bell and was not surprised to                 see                 that Hugh was still as fat as ever. He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk. It was                 obvious that he was very embarrassed. When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel                 on the desk. He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally. Then he showed me                 the contents of the parcel. It contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>diet</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 规定饮食（为健康或减肥等目的）；规定饮食的时期；节食|a limited variety or amount of food that you eat for medical reasons                                 or                                 because you want to lose weight; a time when you only eat this limited variety or amount</dt> <dd>a low-fat, salt-free diet|低脂肪无盐的饮食</dd> <dd>diet drinks (= with fewer calories than normal)|低热量饮料</dd> <dd>I decided to go on a diet (= to lose weight) before my holiday.|我决定在休假前节食。</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>chocolate</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 巧克力；朱古力|a hard brown sweet food made from cocoa beans , used in cooking to add flavour to cakes, etc. or                                 eaten as a sweet/candy</dt> <dd>see also milk chocolate, plain chocolate</dd> <dd>a bar/piece of chocolate|一条 / 一块巧克力</dd> <dd>a chocolate cake|巧克力蛋糕</dd> <dd>a chocolate factory|巧克力制造厂</dd> <dt>n.[C] 巧克力糖；夹心巧克力糖|a sweet/candy that is made of or covered with chocolate</dt> <dd>a box of chocolates|一盒巧克力糖</dd> </dl> <p><u>milk chocolate</u> n.[U]牛奶巧克力</p> <p><u>plain chocolate</u> n.(=dark chocolate) (不加牛奶的)纯巧克力，黑巧克力</p> </section> </section>	</template>
