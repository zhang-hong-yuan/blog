<article> <h1>Never too old to learn</h1> <p>How long has Mr. Page been teaching?</p> <p>I have just received a letter                 from my old school, 【informing】 me that my former headmaster, Mr. Stuart Page, will be retiring next week. Pupils of                 the                 school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion. All those who have contributed towards the                 gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's home. We shall all remember Mr.                 Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly to                 school. A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a curious                 coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr. Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years. After                 he                 has retired, he will devote himself to gardening. For him, this will be an entirely new hobby. But this does not                 matter, for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>inform</h4> <dl> <dt>v.知会；通知；通告|to tell sb about sth, especially in an official way</dt> <dd>[VN] Please inform us of any changes of address.|地址若有变动请随时通知我们。</dd> <dd>[VN that] I have been reliably informed (= somebody I trust has told me) that the couple will marry next                                 year.|我得到可靠消息说他们俩明年结婚。</dd> <dd>[VN speech] ‘He's already left,’ she informed us.|“他已经走了。”她告诉我们说。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
