		<h1>An exciting trip</h1>
	<p>Why is Tim finding this trip exciting?</p>
	<p>I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He is in Australia. He has been there for six months. Tim is an
		【engineer】. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.
		He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice springs, a small town in the centre of Australia. He will
		soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never been abroad before, so he is fending this
		trip very exciting.</p>
