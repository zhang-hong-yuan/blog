<article> <h1>After the elections</h1> <p>Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question?</p> <p>The former Prime                 Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections. He is now retiring from political life and has                 gone abroad. My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical 【opponent】 of Mr. Lane's Radical Progressive Party.                 After                 the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house. When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there, the                 policeman                 on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad. On the following day, Patrick went to                 the house again. The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question.                 Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer. The day after, Patrick went to the                 house                 once more and asked exactly the same question. This time, the policeman lost his temper. 'I told you yesterday and                 the                 day before yesterday,' he shouted, 'Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections. He has retired from political life and                 gone to live abroad!""</p> <p>'I know,' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>opponent</h4> <dl> <dt>n.~ (of sth) 反对者；阻止者|a person who is against sth and tries to change or stop it</dt> <dd>opponents of abortion|反对堕胎的人</dd> <dd>opponents of the regime|反对政权的人</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
