<article> <h1>Volcanoes</h1> <p>Why does Tazieff 【risk】 his life like this?</p> <p>Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist,                 has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake                 Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very                 close                 to the volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he                 could                 not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It                 threatened                 to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and                 he was able to return two days later. This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take                 photographs and measure temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us                 more                 about active volcanoes than any man alive.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>risk</h4> <dl> <dt>v.[VN] 使…冒风险（或面临危险）|to put sth valuable or important in a dangerous situation, in which it could be lost or                                 damaged</dt> <dd>He risked his life to save her.|他冒着生命危险去救她。</dd> <dd>She was risking her own and her children's health.|她在使自己和子女的健康遭受威胁。</dd> <dd>He risked all his money on a game of cards.|他冒险把自己所有的钱都押在了一场纸牌游戏上。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
