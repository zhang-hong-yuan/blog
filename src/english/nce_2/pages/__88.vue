<article> <h1>Trapped in a mine</h1> <p>Why is the rescue taking so long?</p> <p>Six men have been trapped in a 【mine】 for                 seventeen hours. If they are not brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives. However, rescue operations                 are                 proving difficult. If explosives are used, vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse. Rescue workers                 are                 therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine. They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule. If                 there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil, they would have completed the job in a few hours. As it                 is,                 they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was                 lowered into the mine two hours ago, has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives. Though they                 are running out of food and drink, the men are cheerful and confident that they will get out soon. They have been                 told                 that rescue operations are progressing smoothly. If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock,                 they would lose heart.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>mine</h4> <dl> <dt>n.矿井；矿|a deep hole or holes under the ground where minerals such as coal, gold, etc. are dug</dt> <dd>a copper/diamond mine|铜 / 钻石矿</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
