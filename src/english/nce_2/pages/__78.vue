<article> <h1>The last one？</h1> <p>For how long did the writer give up smoking?</p> <p>After reading an 【article】                 entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I smoked with concentration and                 pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette. For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this                 time, my wife suffered terribly. I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an                 enormous appetite. My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to hide their amusement                 whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket. After seven days of this I went to a party. Everybody around                 me                 was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more                 than I could bear. I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had                 returned to normal once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.                 He himself has done it lots of times!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>article</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（报刊上的）文章，论文，报道|a piece of writing about a particular subject in a newspaper or magazine</dt> <dd>Have you seen that article about young fashion designers?|你见到了关于年轻时装设计师的那篇文章没有？</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
