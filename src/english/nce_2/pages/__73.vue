<article> <h1>The record-holder</h1> <p>Did the boy go where he wanted to?</p> <p>Children who play 【truant】 from school                 are unimaginative. A quiet days fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is                 usually as far as they get. They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600                 miles.                 He hitchhiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep. When he woke up next                 morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the meantime, travelled to Calais. No one noticed the boy as he crept                 off. From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry. The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left                 him just outside the city. The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it                 would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border. There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England                 by the local authorities. He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school.         </p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>truant</h4> <dl> <dt>n.旷课的小学生|a child who stays away from school without permission</dt> <dt>v.旷课</dt> <dd>[V] A number of pupils have been truanting regularly.|不少小学生一直经常旷课。</dd> <dt>phr.play truant 旷课；逃学|to stay away from school without permission</dt> <dd>How dared you to play truant!|你竟敢逃学。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
