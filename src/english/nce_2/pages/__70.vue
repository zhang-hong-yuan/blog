<article> <h1>Red for 【danger】</h1> <p>How was the drunk removed from the ring?</p> <p>During a bullfight, a drunk                 suddenly wandered into the middle of the ring. The crowd began to shout, but the drunk was unaware of the danger.                 The                 bull was busy with the matador at the time, but it suddenly caught sight of the drunk who was shouting rude remarks                 and waving a red cap. Apparently sensitive to criticism, the bull forgot all about the matador and charged at the                 drunk. The crowd suddenly grew quiet. The drunk, however, seemed quite sure of himself. When the bull got close to                 him, he clumsily stepped aside to let it pass. The crowd broke into cheers and the drunk bowed. By this time,                 however,                 three men had come into the ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety. Even the bull seemed to feel sorry                 for                 him, for it looked on sympathetically until the drunk was out of the way before once more turning its attention to                 the                 matador.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>danger</h4> <dl> <dt>n.危险；风险|the possibility of sth happening that will injure, harm or kill sb, or damage or destroy sth</dt> <dd>Danger!
