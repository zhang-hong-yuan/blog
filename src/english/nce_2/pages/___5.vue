	<p>What does No wrong numbers mean?</p>
	<p>Mr.James Scott has a 【garage】 in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only
		five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve
		pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in
		three minutes. Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one
		garage to the other. In this way, he has begun his own private telephone service.</p>
