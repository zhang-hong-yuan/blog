<article> <h1>A wet night</h1> <p>What happened to the boys in the night?</p> <p>Late in the afternoon, the boys put up                 their 【tent】 in the middle of a field. As soon as this was done, they cooked a meal over an open fire. They were all                 hungry and the food smelled good. After a wonderful meal, they told stories and sang songs by the campfire. But some                 time later it began to rain. The boys felt tired so they put out the fire and crept into their tent. Their sleeping                 bags were warm and comfortable, so they all slept soundly. In the middle of the night, two boys woke up and began                 shouting. The tent was full of water! They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and hurried outside. It was raining                 heavily and they found that a stream had formed in the field. The stream wound its way across the field and then                 flowed right under their tent!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>tent</h4> <dl> <dt>n.帐篷；帐棚|a shelter made of a large sheet of canvas , nylon , etc. that is supported by poles and ropes fixed to                                 the ground, and is used especially for camping</dt> <dd>to put up/take down a tent|搭 / 拆帐篷</dd> <dd>to pitch (= put up) a tent|搭帐篷</dd> <dd>Food will be served in the hospitality tent (= for example at an outdoor show).|招待帐篷将有食物供应。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
