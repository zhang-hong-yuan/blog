<article> <h1>A blessing in disguise？</h1> <p>Why does the vicar refuse to cut down the tree?</p> <p>The tiny village of                 Frinley is said to possess a cursed tree. Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to                 Frinley has now 【increased】. The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it is only in recent years                 that                 it has gained an evil reputation. It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a                 leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been                 asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of                 income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said,                 the                 tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck                 down by sudden death!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>increase</h4> <dl> <dt>v.（使）增长，增多；增加|to become or to make sth greater in amount, number, value, etc.</dt> <dd>反义词： decrease</dd> <dd>[V] The population has increased from 1.2 million to 1.8 million.|人口已从120万增加到了180万。</dd> <dd>The rate of inflation increased by 2%.|通货膨胀率增长了2%。</dd> <dd>The price of oil increased.|石油价格上涨了。</dd> <dd>increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere|地球大气层中日益增多的二氧化碳含量</dd> <dd>Oil increased in price.|石油价格上涨了。</dd> <dd>Disability increases with age (= the older sb is, the more likely they are to be disabled).|身体机能随着年龄退化。</dd> <dd>[VN] We need to increase productivity.|我们需要提高生产力。</dd> <dd>They've increased the price by 50%.|他们已经把价格提高了50%。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
