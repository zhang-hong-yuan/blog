	<p>Who is Percy Buttons?</p>
	<p>I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a 【beggar】 knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and
		a glass of beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food
		and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him.
		Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks
		for a meal and a glass of beer.</p>
