<article> <h1>Out of the 【limelight】</h1> <p>Why was their disguise 'too perfect'?</p> <p>An ancient bus stopped by a dry                 river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off. Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes, they had                 taken                 special precautions so that no one should recognize them. But as they soon discovered, disguises can sometimes be                 too                 perfect.</p> <p>'This is a wonderful place for a picnic,' said Gloria Gleam.</p> <p>'It couldn't be better, Gloria,'                 Brinksley Meers agreed. 'No newspaper men, no film fans! Why don't we come more often?'</p> <p>Meanwhile, two other                 actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves, had carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some                 trees.                 When they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared. He looked very angry. 'Now you get out of                 here, all of you!' he shouted. 'I'm sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says “No Camping” —— in case you                 can't read!'</p> <p>'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, 'don't be too hard on us. I'm Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.'         </p> <p>'Oh, is it?' said the sheriff with a sneer. 'Well, I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam.                 Now                 you get out of here fast!'</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>limelight</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 公众注意的中心|the centre of public attention</dt> <dd>to be in the limelight|成为公众注目的中心</dd> <dd>to stay out of the limelight|避免引人注目</dd> <dd>to steal/hog the limelight (= take attention away from other people)|把公众的注意力吸引过来</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
