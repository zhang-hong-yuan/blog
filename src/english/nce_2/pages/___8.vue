		<h1>The best and the worst</h1>
	<p>Why is Joes garden the most beautiful one in the town?</p>
	<p>Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. 【Nearly】 everybody enters for The Nicest Garden Competition
		each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Friths garden is larger than Joes. Bill works harder than Joe and grows
		more flowers and vegetables, but Joes garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden
		bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I enter for the garden competition
		too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!</p>
