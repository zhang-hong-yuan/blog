<article> <h1>April Fools' Day</h1> <p>What was the joke?</p> <p>To end our special news 【bulletin】,' said the voice of the                 television announcer, 'we're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria. Macaroni has been grown in this area for                 over six hundred years. Two of the leading growers, Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante, tell me that they have                 been expecting a splendid crop this year and harvesting has begun earlier than usual. Here you can see two workers                 who, between them, have just finished cutting three cartloads of golden brown macaroni stalks. The whole village has                 been working day and night gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September rains. On the right, you                 can                 see Mrs. Brabante herself. She has been helping her husband for thirty years now. Mrs. Brabante is talking to the                 manager of the local factory where the crop is processed. This last scene shows you what will happen at the end of                 the                 harvest: the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition! Signor Fratelli, the present champion, has won it every                 year since 1991. And that ends our special bulletin for today, Thursday, April lst. We're now going back to the                 studio.'</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>bulletin</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（电台或电视台的）新闻简报|a short news report on the radio or television</dt> <dd>A half-hourly news bulletin|每半小时发布一次的新闻简报</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
