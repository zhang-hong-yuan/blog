<article> <h1>What's for supper？</h1> <p>What kind of fish are they?</p> <p>Fish and chips has always been a favourite                 【dish】 in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive. So it comes as a                 surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repaired                 frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of                 their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work. Now they have had special cages made to protect them from                 these monsters. The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which                 grow                 to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length. Three factors have caused these fish to grow so                 large:                 the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on                 the rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow                 and                 grow in the lovely warm water.
