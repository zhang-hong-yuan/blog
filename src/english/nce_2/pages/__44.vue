<article> <h1>Through the forest</h1> <p>How did Mrs. Sterling get her bag back?</p> <p>Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think                 of the risk she was taking when she ran through a 【forest】 after two men. They had rushed up to her while she was                 having                 a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag. In the struggle, the strap broke                 and, with the bag in their possession, both men started running through the trees. Mrs. Sterling got so angry that                 she                 ran after them. She was soon out of breath, but she continued to run. When she caught up with them, she saw that                 they                 had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag, so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright                 that they dropped the bag and ran away. The strap needs mending, said Mrs. Sterling later, but they did not steal                 anything.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>forest</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C, U] 森林；林区|a large area of land that is thickly covered with trees</dt> <dd>a tropical forest|热带森林</dd> <dd>a forest fire|森林火灾</dd> <dd>Thousands of hectares of forest are destroyed each year.|每年都有几千公顷的森林遭到破坏。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
