<article> <h1>Out of control</h1> <p>What was the danger?</p> <p>As the man tried to swing the 【speedboat】 round, the                 steering wheel came away in his hands. He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water skiing for the last                 fifteen minutes. Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently into the                 sea. The speedboat had struck a buoy, but it continued to move very quickly across the water. Both men had just                 begun                 to swim towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle. It now came                 straight towards them at tremendous speed. In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away. After it                 had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return. They had just                 had                 enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle. On this occasion, however, it had slowed                 down considerably. The petrol had nearly all been used up. Before long, the noise dropped completely and the boat                 began to drift gently across the water.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>speedboat</h4> <dl> <dt>n.快艇|a boat with a motor that can travel very fast</dt> <dd>The speedboat took off, skimming the waves.|快艇擦着波浪飞驰而去。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
