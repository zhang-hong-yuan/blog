<article> <h1>Three men in a basket</h1> <p>Where was the station's Commanding Officer?</p> <p>A pilot noticed a 【balloon】                 which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby. He informed the station at once, but no one there                 was                 able to explain the mystery. The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news, because                 balloons                 can be a great danger to aircraft. He said that someone might be spying on the station and the pilot was ordered to                 keep track of the strange object. The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time. He could make out three men                 in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars. When the balloon was over the station, the                 pilot saw one of the men taking photographs. Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an                 airfield. The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone, for the basket contained two Members of                 Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station! As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the                 station did not know what the other half was doing!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>balloon</h4> <dl> <dt>n.also hot-air balloon 热气球|a large balloon made of strong material that is filled with hot air or gas to make                                 it rise in the air, usually carrying a basket for passengers</dt> <dd>The balloon was invented before the plane.|热气球是在飞机发明之前发明的。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
