<article> <h1>Jumbo 【versus】 the police</h1> <p>Why did the police have to push Jumbo off the main street?</p> <p>Last                 Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a childrens hospital. Dressed up as                 Father                 Christmas and accompanied by a guard of honour of six pretty girls, he set off down the main street of the city                 riding                 a baby elephant called Jumbo. He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing. A policeman                 approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though                 Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main                 street. The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused. Jumbo must weigh a few tons, said a policeman                 afterwards, so it was fortunate that we didnt have to carry him. Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a                 good                 record, we shall let him off this time.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>versus</h4> <dl> <dt>prep.(abbr. v) (abbr. vs) (especially sport 体 or law 律)（表示两队或双方对阵）对，诉，对抗|used to show that two teams or sides                                 are against each other</dt> <dd>It is France versus Brazil in the final.|决赛是法国队对巴西队。</dd> <dd>in the case of the State versus Ford|在州政府诉福特公司的案件中</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
