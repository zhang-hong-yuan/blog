<article> <h1>【Expensive】 and uncomfortable</h1> <p>What did the man in this story do?</p> <p>When a plane from London                 arrived at Sydney airport, workers began to unload a number of wooden boxes which contained clothing. No one could                 account for the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy. It suddenly occurred to one of the workers to open                 up                 the box. He was astonished at what he found. A man was lying in the box on top of a pile of woolen goods. He was so                 surprised at being discovered that he did not even try to run away. After he was arrested, the man admitted hiding                 in                 the box before the plane left London. He had had a long and uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the                 wooden                 box for over eighteen hours. The man was ordered to pay $3,500 for the cost of the trip. The normal price of a                 ticket                 is $2,000!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>expensive</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.昂贵的；花钱多的；价格高的|costing a lot of money</dt> <dd>反义词： inexpensive</dd> <dd>an expensive car/restaurant/holiday|昂贵的汽车；高档的餐馆；花费大的假日</dd> <dd>Art books are expensive to produce.|美术书籍制作成本高。</dd> <dd>I can't afford it, it's too expensive.|我买不起，太贵了。</dd> <dd>Making the wrong decision could prove expensive.|错误的决策可能会付出昂贵的代价。</dd> <dd>That dress was an expensive mistake.|那件连衣裙看走眼买贵了。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
