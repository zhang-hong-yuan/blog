<article> <h1>But not 【murder】!</h1> <p>Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?</p> <p>I was being                 tested for a driving licence for the third time. I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so                 successfully. After having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence. Sure that I had                 passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test. The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he                 smiled and said. Just one more thing, Mr.Eames. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of                 you.                 As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet. I continued driving and after some time, the                 examiner                 tapped loudly, Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react. I suddenly pressed the                 brake                 pedal and we were both thrown forward. The examiner looked at me sadly. Mr.Eames, he said, in a mournful voice, you                 have just killed that child!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>murder</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U, C] 谋杀；凶杀|the crime of killing sb deliberately</dt> <dd>同义词： homicide</dd> <dd>He was found guilty of murder.|经裁决，他犯有谋杀罪。</dd> <dd>She has been charged with the attempted murder of her husband.|她被指控意图谋杀丈夫。</dd> <dd>to commit (a) murder|犯谋杀罪</dd> <dd>a murder case/investigation/trial|凶杀案件 / 调查；谋杀案的审判</dd> <dd>The rebels were responsible for the mass murder of 400 civilians.|叛乱者对屠杀400名平民负有责任。</dd> <dd>What was the murder weapon?|用的是什么凶器？</dd> <dd>The play is a murder mystery.|这出戏说的是一桩神秘的凶杀案。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
