<article> <h1>The end of the dream</h1> <p>How did the dream end?</p> <p>Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in                 Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed. For the first time in his life, he became the proud owner of a bed                 which                 had 【springs】 and a mattress. Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house. He                 slept                 very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the                 roof                 and sent it crashing into the courtyard below. The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground.                 Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the                 mattress. Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and                 carried                 it into his house. After he had put it on the floor, he promptly went to sleep again.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>spring</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 弹簧；发条|a twisted piece of metal that can be pushed, pressed or pulled but which always returns to its                                 original shape or position afterwards</dt> <dd>bed springs|床垫弹簧</dd> <dt>n.[U] 弹性；弹力|the ability of a spring to return to its original position</dt> <dd>The mattress has lost its spring.|那个床垫失去弹性了。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
