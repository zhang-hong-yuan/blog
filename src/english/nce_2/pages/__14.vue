		<p>I had an 【amusing】 experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the

			car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know
			any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young man
			suddenly said, very slowly, """"Do you speak English? As I soon learnt, he was English himself!</p>
