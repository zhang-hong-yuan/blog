<article> <h1>Monster or fish？</h1> <p>What was the 【monster】 called?</p> <p>Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have                 seen monsters in the sea. Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen, it is now known that many of                 these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures are                 washed                 to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near                 Madagascar. A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.                 Realizing                 that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually                 brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long. It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining                 silver skin, and a bright red tail. The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a                 scientist, is called an oarfish. Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a 【depth】 of six                 hundred feet.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>monster</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（传说中的）怪物，怪兽|(in stories) an imaginary creature that is very large, ugly and frightening</dt> <dd>a monster with three heads|三头怪兽</dd> <dd>prehistoric monsters|史前怪物</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>depth</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C, U] 向下的距离；深（度）；纵深|the distance from the top or surface to the bottom of sth</dt> <dd>What's the depth of the water here?|这儿的水有多深？</dd> <dd>Water was found at a depth of 30 metres.|在30米深处找到了水。</dd> <dd>They dug down to a depth of two metres.|他们挖到两米深。</dd> <dd>Many dolphins can dive to depths of 200 metres.|许多海豚可潜到200米深。</dd> <dd>The oil well extended several hundreds of feet in depth.|油井向下延伸了数百英尺。</dd> <dd>the depth of a cut/wound/crack|刀口 / 伤口 / 裂口深度</dd> <dt>n.[C, U] 向里的距离；深（度）；宽（度）|the distance from the front to the back of sth</dt> <dd>The depth of the shelves is 30 centimetres.|书架的深度为30厘米。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
