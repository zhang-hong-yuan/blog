<article> <h1>Not very musical</h1> <p>What happened when the 【snake charmer】 began to play jazz?</p> <p>As we had had a                 long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we stopped at a square to have a rest. After a time, we noticed a                 snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him. As soon as                 he                 saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets. When he began to play a                 tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake. It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the                 pipe.                 We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs. The snake,                 however, continued to dance slowly. It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>snake charmer</h4> <dl> <dt>n.耍蛇人；弄蛇人|an entertainer who seems to be able to control snakes and make them move by playing music to them                         </dt> <dd>The next act will be a snake charmer.|下一个节目是玩蛇。</dd> <dd>The snake charmer reached out gingerly to touch the snake in his basket.|耍蛇人小心翼翼地伸手去摸他筐子里的那条蛇。</dd> </dl> <h4>snake</h4> <dl> <dt>n.蛇|a reptile with a very long thin body and no legs.
