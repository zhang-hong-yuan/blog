<article> <h1>A polite request</h1> <p>What was the polite 【request】?</p> <p>If you park your car in the wrong place, a                 traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does                 not                 always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car:                 sir,                 we welcome you to our city. This is a """"No Parking"""" area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our                 street signs. This note is only a reminder. If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>request</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（正式或礼貌的）要求，请求|the action of asking for sth formally and politely</dt> <dd>They made a request for further aid.|他们要求再给一些帮助。</dd> <dd>He was there at the request of his manager/at his manager's request (= because his manager had asked him to                                 go).|他按照经理的要求到了那里。</dd> <dd>The writer's name was withheld by request (= because the writer asked for this to be done).|按照作者的要求，其姓名不予公布。                         </dd> <dd>Catalogues are available on request.|有目录备索。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
