		<h1>Breakfast or lunch?</h1>
	<p>Why was the writer's aunt surprised?</p>
	<p>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until 【lunchtime】. Last Sunday I got up
		very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.' Just
		then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'</p>
	<p>'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.</p>
	<p>'What are you doing?' she asked.</p>
	<p>'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.</p>
	<p>'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'</p>
