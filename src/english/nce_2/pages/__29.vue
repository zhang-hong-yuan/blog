<article> <h1>Taxi！</h1> <p>Does Captain Fawcett think any trip is too dangerous?</p> <p>Captain Ben Fawcett has bought                 an unusual 【taxi】 and has begun a new service. The taxi is a small Swiss aeroplane called a Pilatus Porter. This                 wonderful plane can carry seven passengers. The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land                 anywhere:                 on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field. Captain Fawcetts first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham                 to                 a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places.                 Once                 he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. Captain Fawcett                 has just refused a strange request from a businessman. The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the                 Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>taxi</h4> <dl> <dt>n.also cab, taxicab 出租汽车；计程车；的士|a car with a driver that you pay to take you somewhere.
