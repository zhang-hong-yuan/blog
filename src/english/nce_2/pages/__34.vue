<article> <h1>Quick work</h1> <p>How long had the police taken to find his bicycle?</p> <p>Dan Robinson has been worried                 all week. Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police. In the letter he was asked to call at the                 station.                 Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to the station yesterday and now he is not worried                 anymore.                 At the station, he was told by a smiling policeman that his bicycle had been found. Five days ago, the policeman                 told                 him, the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away. It is now being sent to his home by                 train.                 Dan was most surprised when he heard the news. He was 【amused】 too, because he never expected the bicycle to be                 found.                 It was stolen twenty years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>amused</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.逗乐的；觉得好笑的|thinking that sb/sth is funny, so that you smile or laugh</dt> <dd>There was an amused look on the President's face.|总统面带愉悦的神情。</dd> <dd>We were all amused at his stories.|我们都被他的故事逗笑了。</dd> <dd>He was amused to see how seriously she took the game.|他看见她玩这个游戏十分认真的样子，觉得好笑。</dd> <dd>Janet was not amused (= she was annoyed or angry).|珍妮特感到不悦。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
