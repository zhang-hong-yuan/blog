<article> <h1>Asking for trouble</h1> <p>Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station?</p> <p>It                 must have been about two in the morning when I returned home. I tried to wake up my wife by 【ringing】 the doorbell,                 but                 she was fast asleep, so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and began climbing                 towards the bedroom window. I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need                 cleaning at this time of the night.' I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman. I                 immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'</p> <p>'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man when                 he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'</p> <p>'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my key.'</p> <p>'Your what?' he called.</p> <p>'My key,' I shouted.</p> <p>Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards                 me.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>ring</h4> <dl> <dt>v.（使）发出钟声，响起铃声|if you ring a bell or if a bell rings , it produces a sound</dt> <dd>[VN] Someone was ringing the doorbell.|有人在按门铃。</dd> <dd>[V] The church bells rang.|教堂的钟声响了。</dd> <dd>Just ring for the nurse (= attract the nurse's attention by ringing a bell) if you need her.|如果需要护士，按一下铃就行了。                         </dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
