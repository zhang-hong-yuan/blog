<article> <h1>Persistent</h1> <p>Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?</p> <p>I crossed the                 street to 【avoid】 meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not                 seen                 him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are,                 he                 always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all                 morning.</p> <p>‘Hello, Nigel,’ I said. ‘Fancy meeting you here!’</p> <p>‘Hi, Elizabeth,’ Nigel answered. ‘I was just wondering how to spend the morning — until I saw you. You're not busy                 doing anything, are you?’</p> <p>‘No, not at all,’ I answered. ‘Im going to ...’</p> <p>‘Would you mind my coming with you?’ he asked, before I had finished speaking.</p> <p>‘Not at all,’ I lied, ‘but Im going to the dentist.’</p> <p>‘Then I'll come with you,’ he answered. ‘There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!’</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>avoid</h4> <dl> <dt>v.回避；避开；躲避|to keep away from sb/sth; to try not to do sth</dt> <dd>[VN] He's been avoiding me all week.|整整一个星期他一直在回避我。</dd> <dd>She kept avoiding my eyes (= avoided looking at me).|她总是躲避我的目光。</dd> <dd>I left early to avoid the rush hour.|我早早动身以避开交通高峰时刻。</dd> <dd>[V -ing] I've been avoiding getting down to work all day.|我一整天都刻意不投入工作。</dd> <dd>You should avoid mentioning his divorce.|你应该避免提及他离婚的事。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
