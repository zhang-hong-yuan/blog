<article> <h1>She was not amused</h1> <p>Why did Jenny want to leave the wedding reception?</p> <p>Jeremy Hampden has a                 large 【circle】 of friends and is very popular at parties. Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour --                 everybody, that is, except his six-year-old daughter, Jenny. Recently, one of Jeremys closest friends asked him to                 make a speech at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves. He prepared the speech carefully                 and went to the wedding with Jenny. he had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it                 was a great success. As soon as he had finished, Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a little                 disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked. On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the                 speech.                 To his surprise, she said she hadnt. Jeremy asked her why this was so and she told him that she did not like to see                 so                 many people laughing at him!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>circle</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（相同兴趣、职业等的人形成的）圈子，阶层，界|a group of people who are connected because they have the same interests, jobs, etc.                         </dt> <dd>the family circle|家庭圈子</dd> <dd>She's well known in theatrical circles.|她在戏剧界赫赫有名。</dd> <dd>a large circle of friends|一大群朋友</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
