<article> <h1>Success story</h1> <p>What was Franks first job?</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me                 about his 【experiences】 as a young man. Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company, but                 as                 a                 boy he used to work in a small shop. It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen                 hours                 a day. He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own. In his twenties Frank used to                 make                 spare parts for aeroplanes. At that time he had two helpers. In a few years the small workshop had become a large                 factory which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people. Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years                 and                 the long road to success. He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair                 their grandsons bicycle!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>experience</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 经历；阅历|the things that have happened to you that influence the way you think and behave</dt> <dd>Experience has taught me that life can be very unfair.|经过的事使我懂得生活可能是很不公平的。</dd> <dd>It is important to try and learn from experience.|努力从经验中学习是重要的。</dd> <dd>In my experience , very few people really understand the problem.|据我的经验看，真正理解这个问题的人很少。</dd> <dd>She knew from past experience that Ann would not give up easily.|她凭以往的经验知道安是不会轻易放弃的。</dd> <dd>The book is based on personal experience.|本书是根据个人经历写成的。</dd> <dd>direct/first-hand experience of poverty|对贫穷的直接 / 亲身感受</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
