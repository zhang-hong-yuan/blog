<article> <h1>Across the Channel</h1> <p>What is Debbie going to try to do?</p> <p>Debbie Hart is going to swim across                 the English 【Channel】 tomorrow. She is going to set out from the French coast at five oclock in the morning. Debbie                 is                 only eleven years old and she hopes to set up a new world record. She is a strong swimmer and many people feel that                 she is sure to succeed. Debbies father will set out with her in a small boat. Mr. Hart has trained his daughter for                 years. Tomorrow he will be watching her anxiously as she swims the long distance to England. Debbie intends to take                 short rests every two hours. She will have something to drink but she will not eat any solid food. Most of Debbies                 school friends will be waiting for her on the English coast. Among them will be Debbies mother, who swam the Channel                 herself when she was a girl.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>channel</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 海峡|a passage of water that connects two areas of water, especially two seas</dt> <dd>the Bristol Channel|布里斯托尔海峡</dd> <dd>n.the Channel [sing.] 英吉利海峡|the area of sea between England and France, also known as the English Channel</dd> <dd>the Channel Tunnel|英吉利海峡隧道</dd> <dd>cross-Channel ferries|横渡英吉利海峡的渡船</dd> <dd>news from across the Channel (= from France)|来自英吉利海峡对岸（指法国）的消息</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
