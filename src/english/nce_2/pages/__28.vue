<article> <h1>No parking</h1> <p>What is Jasper Whites problem?</p> <p>Jasper White is one of those 【rare】 people who                 believes in ancient myths. he has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in, he has had                 trouble                 with cars and their owners. When he returns home at night, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his                 gate. Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once. Jasper has put up No                 Parking                 signs outside his gate, but these have not had any effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate. It is                 one                 of the ugliest faces I have ever seen. I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. jasper                 hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has been turned to stone yet!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>rare</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.稀少的；稀罕的|not done, seen, happening, etc. very often</dt> <dd>a rare disease/occurrence/sight|罕见的疾病 / 事件；难得一见的事物</dd> <dd>It's extremely rare for it to be this hot in April.|四月份就这样炎热是极其罕见的。</dd> <dd>It is rare to find such loyalty these days.|这样忠心耿耿，在今天非常少见。</dd> <dd>On the rare occasions when they met he hardly even dared speak to her.|彼此难得相见，他还几乎不敢跟她说话。</dd> <dd>It was a rare (= very great) honour to be made a fellow of the college.|成为这所学院的研究员是极大的荣誉。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
