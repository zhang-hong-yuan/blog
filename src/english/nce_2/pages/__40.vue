<article> <h1>Food and talk</h1> <p>Was Mrs. Rumbold a good companion at dinner?</p> <p>Last week at a dinner party,                 the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs. Rumbold. Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a 【tight】 black dress.                 She                 did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was                 busy eating. I tried to make conversation.</p> <p>‘A new play is coming to “The Globe” soon,’ I said. ‘Will you be seeing it?’</p> <p>‘No,’ she answered.</p> <p>‘Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?’ I asked.</p> <p>‘No,’ she answered.</p> <p>‘Will you be staying in England?’ I asked.</p> <p>‘No,’ she answered.</p> <p>In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.</p> <p>‘Young man,’ she answered, ‘if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!’</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>tight</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.紧身的；紧贴的|fitting closely to your body and sometimes uncomfortable</dt> <dd>反义词： loose</dd> <dd>She was wearing a tight pair of jeans.|她穿着一条紧身牛仔裤。</dd> <dd>These shoes are much too tight.|这双鞋太紧了。</dd> <dd>The new sweater was a tight fit.|这件新毛衣很贴身。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
