<article> <h1>Football or polo？</h1> <p>What happened to the man in the boat?</p> <p>The Wayle is a small river that                 cuts across the park near my home. I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons. It was warm last Sunday, so I                 went                 and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing                 on                 the river. Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat. Some people on                 the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he nearly                 fell                 into the water. I turned to look at the children, but there werent any in 【sight】: they had all run away! The man                 laughed when he realized what had happened. He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>sight</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 视力范围；视野|the area or distance within which sb can see or sth can be seen</dt> <dd>There was no one in sight.|一个人也看不见。</dd> <dd>At last we came in sight of a few houses.|最后，我们看到了几座房屋。</dd> <dd>A bicycle came into sight on the main road.|大路上出现了一辆自行车。</dd> <dd>The end is in sight (= will happen soon).|结局已现端倪。</dd> <dd>Leave any valuables in your car out of sight.|把贵重物品留在车里看不见的地方。</dd> <dd>Keep out of sight (= stay where you cannot be seen).不要露面。</dd> <dd>She never lets her daughter out of her sight (= always keeps her where she can see her).她从来不让女儿走出她的视线。</dd> <dd>Get out of my sight!
