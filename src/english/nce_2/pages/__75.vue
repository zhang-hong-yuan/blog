<article> <h1>SOS</h1> <p>How did the woman get help?</p> <p>When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago,                 it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed. The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters,                 were unhurt. It was the middle of winter. Snow lay thick on the ground. The woman knew that the nearest village was                 miles away. When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with                 all                 the clothes she could find. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the                 children and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small. Early next morning, she heard planes                 passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal. Then she had an idea. She stamped out the letters 'SOS'                 in                 the snow. Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. It was not long                 before                 a 【helicopter】 arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>helicopter</h4> <dl> <dt>n.直升机|an aircraft without wings that has large blades on top that go round.
