<article> <h1>Sweet as honey！</h1> <p>What was sweet as honey and why?</p> <p>In 1963 a Lancaster 【bomber】 crashed on                 Wallis Island, a remote place in the South Pacific, a long way west of Samoa. The plane wasnt too badly damaged, but                 over the years, the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed. Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the                 crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. By this time, a Lancaster bomber                 in                 reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing. The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts                 back to France. Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored. It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin                 engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt. Imagine their surprise and delight when they                 broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition. A                 colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>bomber</h4> <dl> <dt>n.轰炸机|a plane that carries and drops bombs</dt> <dd>The sound of the last bomber's engines faded into the distance.｜最后一架轰炸机的引擎声渐渐消失在远方。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
