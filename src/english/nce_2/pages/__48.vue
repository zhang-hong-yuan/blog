<article> <h1>Did you want to tell me something？</h1> <p>Why did the writer become very worried?</p> <p>【Dentists】 always                 ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer. My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told                 me                 to rest for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool. He knew I collected match boxes                 and asked me whether my collection was growing. He then asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my new job                 in                 London. In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching                 out the hole where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say anything. When the dentist at                 last removed the cotton wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>dentist</h4> <dl> <dt>n.also formal dental surgeon 牙科医生|a person whose job is to take care of people's teeth</dt> <dd>Dentists advise you to have your teeth checked every six months.|牙医建议大家每六个月检查一次牙齿。</dd> <dd>Open your mouth a little wider,´ said the dentist.|'把嘴张大点，'牙科医生说。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
