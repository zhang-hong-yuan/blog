<article> <h1>One man in a boat</h1> <p>Why is fishing the writers favourite sport?</p> <p>Fishing is my favourite                 sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky.                 Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and 【rubbish】. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything -- not                 even                 old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. You must give up                 fishing! my friends say. Its a waste of time. But they dont realize one important thing. Im not really interested in                 fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>rubbish</h4> <dl> <dt>n.(especially BrE) 垃圾；废弃物|things that you throw away because you no longer want or need them</dt> <dd>a rubbish bag/bin|垃圾袋 / 桶</dd> <dd>a rubbish dump/heap/tip|垃圾场 / 堆 / 倾倒处</dd> <dd>The streets were littered with rubbish.|街上到处都是垃圾。</dd> <dd>garden/household rubbish|花园 / 生活垃圾</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
