<article> <h1>A pretty carpet</h1> <p>What is the writers 【carpet】 made of?</p> <p>We have just moved into a new house and                 I have been working hard all morning. I have been trying to get my new room in order. This has not been easy because                 I                 own over a thousand books. To make matters worse, the room is rather small, so I have temporarily put my books on                 the                 floor. At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of                 the                 room. A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs. She went into my room                 and                 got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor. This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen, she                 said.                 She gazed at it for some time then added, You dont need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and                 read                 the carpet!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>carpet</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[U] 地毯|a thick woven material made of wool, etc. for covering floors or stairs</dt> <dd>a roll of carpet|一卷地毯</dd> <dt>n.[C] （尤指铺满房间的一块）地毯|a piece of carpet used as a floor covering, especially when shaped to fit a room</dt> <dd>to lay a carpet|铺地毯</dd> <dd>a bedroom carpet|卧室地毯</dd> <dd>(BrE) We have fitted carpets (= carpets from wall to wall) in our house.|我们家的地上都铺了地毯。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
