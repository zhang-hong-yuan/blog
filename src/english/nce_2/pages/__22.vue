<article> <h1>A glass envelop</h1> <p>How did Jane 【receive】 a letter from a stranger?</p> <p>My daughter, Jane, never                 dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the                 Channel                 and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She                 never thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland. Both girls write to                 each other 【regularly】 now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but                 they                 will certainly travel faster.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>receive</h4> <dl> <dt>v.[VN] ~ sth (from sb/sth) (rather formal) 拿到；接到；收到|to get or accept sth that is sent or given to you</dt> <dd>to receive a letter/present/phone call|收到信 / 礼物；接到电话</dd> <dd>to receive information/payment/thanks|接收信息 / 付款；受到感谢</dd> <dd>He received an award for bravery from the police service.|他以其勇敢行为受到警务部门的嘉奖。</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>regularly</h4> <dl> <dt>adv.有规律地；间隙均匀地|at regular intervals or times</dt> <dd>We meet regularly to discuss the progress of the project.|我们定期会面，讨论工程进展情况。</dd> <dt>adv.经常|often</dt> <dd>I go there quite regularly.|我经常去那儿。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
