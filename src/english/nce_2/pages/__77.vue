<article> <h1>A successful operation</h1> <p>Did the doctors find out how the woman died?</p> <p>The 【mummy】 of an                 Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an operation. The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer                 in                 the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying                 to                 find out whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate. The operation, which                 lasted                 for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin. The doctors                 removed                 a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a                 small wax figure of the god Duamutef. This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The                 doctors have not yet decided how the woman died. They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it                 open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy successfully survived the operation.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>mummy</h4> <dl> <dt>n.木乃伊；经处理保存的人体或动物干尸|a body of a human or an animal that has been mummified</dt> <dd>an Egyptian mummy|一具埃及木乃伊</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
