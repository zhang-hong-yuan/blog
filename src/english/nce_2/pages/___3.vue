		<h1>Please send me a card</h1>
	<p>How many cards did the writer send?</p>
	<p>Postcards always 【spoil】 my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A
		friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not
		understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my
		friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day
		in my room, but I did not write a single card!</p>
