<article> <h1>A new house</h1> <p>Why is the new house 【special】?</p> <p>I had a letter from my sister yesterday. She                 lives in Nigeria. In her letter, she said that she would come to England next year. If she comes, she will get a                 surprise. We are now living in a beautiful new house in the country. Work on it had begun before my sister left. The                 house was completed five months ago. In my letter, I told her that she could stay with us. The house has many large                 rooms and there is a lovely garden. It is a very modern house, so it looks strange to some people. It must be the                 only                 modern house in the district.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>special</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.[usually before noun] 特殊的；特别的；不寻常的；不一般的|not ordinary or usual; different from what is normal</dt> <dd>同义词： exceptional</dd> <dd>The school will only allow this in special circumstances.|学校只有在特殊情况下才会同意这种事。</dd> <dd>Some of the officials have special privileges.|有些官员享受特权。</dd> <dd>There is something special about this place.|这个地方有几分特别。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
