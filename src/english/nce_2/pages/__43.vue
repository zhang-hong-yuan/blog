<article> <h1>Over the South Pole</h1> <p>How was the plane able to clear the mountains?</p> <p>In 1929, three years                 after his flight over the North Pole, the American 【explorer】, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for                 the                 first time. Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay                 below, they soon ran into serious trouble. At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash. It could                 only                 get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet. Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks.                 The                 plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet. Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach                 the                 South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more mountains in sight. The aircraft was able to fly over                 the                 endless white plains without difficulty.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>explorer</h4> <dl> <dt>n.探险者；勘探者；考察者|a person who travels to unknown places in order to find out more about them</dt> <dd>Captain Cook was an explorer of the Pacific Ocean.|库克船长是太平洋的探险家。</dd> <dd>Just then, a third man arrived: Japanese explorer Nobu Shirase.|正在这时，第三个人来了：日本探险家 Nobu Shirase。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
