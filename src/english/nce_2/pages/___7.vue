		<h1>Too late</h1>
		<p>Did the 【detectives】 save the diamonds?</p>
		<p>The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of
			diamonds from South Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the
			diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were
			waiting on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two
			detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious parcel was
			full of stones and sand!</p>
