<article> <h1>The dead return</h1> <p>What happens to the lanterns at the end of the festival?</p> <p>A Festival for the                 Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a cheerful 【occasion】, for on this day, the dead are said to                 return                 to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food                 is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way. All                 night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into                 a                 river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the                 tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is                 over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world.                 This                 is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be                 seen no more.</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>occasion</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 特别的事情（或仪式、庆典）|a special event, ceremony or celebration</dt> <dd>a great/memorable/happy occasion|伟大的 / 难忘的 / 欢乐的庆典</dd> <dd>Turn every meal into a special occasion.|要把每一顿饭都弄得特别一些。</dd> <dd>They marked the occasion (= celebrated it) with an open-air concert.|他们举办露天音乐会来庆祝这个特别的时刻。</dd> <dd>Their wedding turned out to be quite an occasion.|他们的婚礼办得相当隆重。</dd> <dd>He was presented with the watch on the occasion of his retirement.|他在退休时获赠这块手表。</dd> <dt>n.[sing.] ~ (for sth/doing sth) 适当的机会；时机|a suitable time for sth</dt> <dd>It should have been an occasion for rejoicing, but she could not feel any real joy.|原本应该是高兴的时刻，她却丝毫未感到快乐。</dd> <dd>I'll speak to him about it if the occasion arises (= if I get a chance).|有机会的话，我要跟他谈谈这件事。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
