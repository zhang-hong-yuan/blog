<article> <h1>Always young</h1> <p>Why doesn‘t Aunt Jennifer tell anyone how old she is?</p> <p>My aunt Jennifer is an                 actress. She must be at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often 【appears】 on the stage as a young                 girl.                 Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of seventeen. In the play, she                 must                 appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a                 bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, ‘Darling, it must be                 terrible to be grown up! ’</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>appear</h4> <dl> <dt>v.[V , usually + adv./prep.] 演出|to take part in a film/movie, play, television programme, etc.</dt> <dd>He has appeared in over 60 movies.|他参演了60多部电影。</dd> <dd>She regularly appears on TV.|她经常在电视上露面。</dd> <dd>Next month he will be appearing as Bush in a new play on Broadway.|下月他将在百老汇上演的一出新戏中扮演布什。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
