<article> <h1>it could be worse</h1> <p>Had the writers money been stolen?</p> <p>I entered the hotel managers office                 and sat down. I had just lost $50 and I felt very 【upset】. I left the money in my room, I said, and its not there                 now.                 The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing. Everyones losing money these days, he said. He started to                 complain about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock at the door. A girl came in and put an envelope on                 his                 desk. It contained $50. I found this outside this gentlemans room, she said. Well, I said to the manager, there is                 still some honesty in this world!</p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>upset</h4> <dl> <dt>adj.[not before noun] ~ (about sth) | ~ (that…) 难过；不高兴；失望；沮丧|unhappy or disappointed because of sth unpleasant                                 that has happened</dt> <dd>There's no point getting upset about it.|犯不着为此事难过。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
