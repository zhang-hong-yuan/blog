<article> <h1>A perfect 【alibi】</h1> <p>What was wrong with the man's story?</p> <p>At the time the murder was committed, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London,' said the man.</p> <p>'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.</p> <p>'Of course I do,' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer will confirm that I was there on                 time.'</p> <p>'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.</p> <p>'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'</p> <p>'At what time did you arrive at the station?'</p> <p>'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'</p> <p>'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'</p> <p>'Of course not.'</p> <p>'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest that you did not catch the 8                 o'clock train, but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time. You see, on the morning of                 the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'         </p> </article><aside></aside> <section> <section> <h4>alibi</h4> <dl> <dt>n.不在犯罪现场证明|evidence that proves that a person was in another place at the time of a crime and so could not                                 have committed it</dt> <dd>The suspects all had alibis for the day of the robbery.|嫌疑人均有证据证明抢劫当天不在犯罪现场。</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
