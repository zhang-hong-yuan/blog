<article> <h1>Tommy's breakfast</h1> <p>When my husband was going into the dining room this morning, he 【dropped】 some 【coins】 on the floor.</p> <p>There were coins everywhere. We looked for them, but we could not find them all.</p> <p>While we were having breakfast, our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.</p> <p>He put them both into his mouth. We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late. Tommy had already 【swallowed】                 them!</p> <p>Late that 【morning】, when I was doing the housework, My husband phoned me from the office.</p> <p>'How's Tommy?' he asked. 'I don't know,' I answered, 'Tommy's been to the 【toilet】 three times this morning, but I                 haven't had any change yet!'<br></p> </article> <section> <section> <h4>drop</h4> <dl> <dt>v.（意外地）落下，掉下，使落下|to fall or allow sth to fall by accident</dt> <dd>[V] The climber slipped and dropped to his death.|攀登者一失足掉下去摔死了。</dd> <dd>[VN] Be careful not to drop that plate.|小心别把盘子摔了。</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>coin</h4> <dl> <dt>n.（一枚）硬币；金属货币|a small flat piece of metal used as money</dt> <dd>a euro coin|欧元硬币</dd> <dt>n.（统称）硬币|money made of metal</dt> <dd>notes and coin|纸币和硬币</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>swallow</h4> <dl> <dt>v.吞下；咽下|to make food, drink, etc. go down your throat into your stomach</dt> <dd>[VN] Always chew food well before swallowing it.|什么食物都要先嚼碎再吞咽。</dd> <dd>[VN-ADJ] The pills should be swallowed whole.|这些药要吞服。</dd> <dd>[V] I had a sore throat and it hurt to swallow.|当时我嗓子疼，咽东西就疼。</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>morning</h4> <dl> <dt>n.早晨；上午|the early part of the day from the time when people wake up until midday or before lunch</dt> <dd>They left for Spain early this morning.|他们今天一早就出发去西班牙了。</dd> <dd>See you tomorrow morning.|明天上午见。</dd> <dd>I prefer coffee in the morning.|我早晨喜欢喝咖啡。</dd> <dd>She woke every morning at the same time.|她每天早上都在同一时间醒来。</dd> <dd>Our group meets on Friday mornings.|我们的组员每周五上午碰面。</dd> <dd>I walk to work most mornings.|我大多数早晨步行去上班。</dd> <dd>We got the news on the morning of the wedding.|我们在举行婚礼的那天上午得到这个消息。</dd> <dd>He's been in a meeting all morning.|他一上午都在开会。</dd> <dd>the morning papers|晨报</dd> <dt>n.午夜至正午的时间|the part of the day from midnight to midday</dt> <dd>I didn't get home until two in the morning!|我凌晨两点才到家。</dd> <dd>He died in the early hours of Sunday morning.|他于星期天凌晨去世。</dd> </dl> </section> <section> <h4>toilet</h4> <dl> <dt>n.[C] 坐便器；抽水马桶|a large bowl attached to a pipe that you sit on or stand over when you get rid of waste matter                                 from your body</dt> <dd>Have you flushed the toilet?|你冲厕所了吗？</dd> <dd>(BrE) I need to go to the toilet (= use the toilet).|我得去趟洗手间。</dd> <dd>a toilet seat|马桶座圈</dd> <dd>toilet facilities|卫生间设备</dd> <dd>Do you need the toilet?|你需要用洗手间吗？</dd> <dt>n.[C] 厕所；卫生间；盥洗室|a room containing a toilet</dt> <dd>Every flat has its own bathroom and toilet.|每套公寓都带有洗澡间和盥洗室。</dd> <dd>Who's in the toilet?|谁在用厕所？</dd> </dl> </section> </section>	</template>
