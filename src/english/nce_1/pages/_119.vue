		<h1>A true story</h1>
		<p>Do you like stories? I want to tell you a true story. It 【happened】 to a friend of mine a year ago.</p>
		<p>While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two 【thieves】 climbed into his kitchen.</p>
		<p>After they had 【entered】 the house, they went into the dining room. It was very dark, so they turned on a 【torch】.
		</p>
		<p>Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them. ""What's up? What's up?"" someone called. The thieves dropped the torch
			and ran away as quickly as they could.</p>
		<p>George heard the noise and came 【downstairs】 quickly.</p>
		<p>He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone. The thieves had 【already】 gone.</p>
		<p>But George's 【parrot】, Henry, was still there. """"What's up, George?"""" the called. 'Nothing, Henry,' George said
			and smiled. 'Go back to sleep.'</p>
