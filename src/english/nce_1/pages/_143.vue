		<h1>A walk through the woods</h1>
		<p>I live in a very old town which is 【surrounded】 by beautiful 【woods】. It is a famous 【beauty】 【spot】. On Sundays,
			hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods. Visitors have been asked to
			keep the woods clean and tidy. 【Litter】 【baskets】 have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their
			【rubbish】 everywhere. Last Wednesday, I went for a walk in the woods. What I saw made me very sad. I counted seven
			old cars and three old refrigerators. The little baskets were 【empty】 and the 【ground】 was 【covered】 with pieces of
			paper, 【cigarette】 ends, old 【tyres】, empty 【bottles】 and 【rusty】 【tins】. Among the rubbish, I found a sign which
			said, 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be 【prosecuted】!'</p>
