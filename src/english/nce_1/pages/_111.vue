It costs five hundred pounds.</li> <br><br> <li>MR. FRITH: That's too expensive for us. We can't afford all that money.</li> <br><br> <li>ASSISTANT: This model's less expensive than that one. It's only three hundred pounds. But, of course, it's not                         as                         good as the expensive one.</li> <br><br> <li>MR. FRITH: I don't like the model. The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.</li> <br><br> <li>MR. FRITH: Can we buy it on 【instalments】?</li> <li>ASSISTANT: Of course. You can pay a 【deposit】 of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three                         years.                 </li> <br><br> <li>MR. FRITH: Do you like it, dear?</li> <li>MRS. FRITH:I certainly do, but I don't like the price. You always want the best, but we can't 【afford】 it.                         Sometimes                         you think you're a 【millionaire】!</li> <li>MR.
