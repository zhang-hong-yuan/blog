I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, &#39;I don&#39;t think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.&#39; I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman. I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, &#39;I enjoy cleaning windows at night.&#39;</p> <p>&#39;So do I,&#39; answered the policeman in the same tone. &#39;Excuse my interrupting you.
