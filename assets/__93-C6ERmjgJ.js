The great statue, which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete. The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the United States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris. The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America. By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi. Ever since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America.</p></article><aside></aside><section><section><h4>noble</h4><dl><dt>adj.崇高的；品质高尚的|having fine personal qualities that people admire, such as courage, honesty and care for others </dt><dd>a noble leader|伟大的领袖</dd><dd>noble ideals|崇高的理想</dd><dd>He died for a noble cause.|他为了高尚的事业而牺牲。</dd></dl></section></section>",3);function a(i,n){return r}const P=e(o,[["render",a]]);export{P as default};
