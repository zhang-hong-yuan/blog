Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line. In this way, he was able to solve the mystery. The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.")],-1),l=e("aside",null,null,-1),d=e("section",null,[e("section",null,[e("h4",null,"end"),t(),e("dl",null,[e("dt",null,"n.(BrE) 剩余物；残余；残片|a small piece that is left after sth has been used"),t(),e("dd",null,"a cigarette end|烟蒂")])])],-1);function h(m,p){return o(),i(n,null,[s,l,t(),d],64)}const L=r(a,[["render",h]]);export{L as default};
